subtitle: Breaking things down in order to build something better.

Web applications are no less complicated than cars, planes, or any other machinery we must regularly upkeep and maintain. Software goes out of date, and as technology grows so much the tools we build with it.

No person is truly capable of comprehensively testing their own application for unintended behavior. Any moral engineer with enough time and resources will design fixes for every problem they could imagine. This is why best practice for security testing requires having testing done by an external resource from the development team.

But application penetration testing is not just about breaking and finding the problems. Resources like the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) can show you everything you need to know about breaking web applications. The true value comes from re-engineering processes and systems to fix the problem at the core.
