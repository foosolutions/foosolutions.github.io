It's a tried, proven and trusted concept within infosec that information sharing is paramount for organizations and professionals to stay on the cutting edge and defend their software and infrastructure from the latest threats. During my forays into video game security, both professional and personal, I was amazed by the lack of published tools and research in the space. There's a number of reasons for this, but that's a topic for a later time.

To be clear, there is a massive community around gaming, and many games have their own ecosystems that form up around them. All of these have a subset community focused on what's refered to as "hacking" or "modding". This community and their sharing, again, are a whole subject unto themselves, and not what I plan to cover.

So this is the first part of a series of posts I plan to write up on the subject of video game security. We will cover setup and operation of a testing environment, and the general attack surface of MMO video games, some common attack and exploit methods, but most importantly hardening the client and server software.

The planned outline is as follows, which I'll update as this series progresses.

1. Game Security Concepts, Risks, and Design
2. Testing Environment Setup: Virtualization
3. Testing Environment Setup: Networking, Tools
4. Video Game Attack Surface
6. File Attacks
7. Memory Attacks
8. Network Attacks
9. Script-Engine Attacks
10. Hardware Input/Output Attacks
11. Game Server Hardening
12. Game Economy Regulation
13. Red Team Practices, Tools, and Development

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to comment below if there's anything else you'd like to see!
